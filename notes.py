Combine Sign-in and Password Manager: Instead of having a separate sign-in window and password manager window, you can modify your code to transform the sign-in window into the password manager window after successful authentication. This way, users don't need to switch between different windows.

Enhance User Interface: Improve the user interface of your password manager by using icons, tooltips, and a clean layout. You can consider using a grid or table view to display password entries and provide options for sorting, filtering, and searching.

Add Password Generator: Include a password generator feature that generates strong and secure passwords. This can help users create unique passwords for their accounts.

Implement Categories and Labels: Allow users to organize their password entries into categories or labels. This can help them group passwords based on different criteria such as work, personal, or finance.

Implement Auto-fill Functionality: Integrate auto-fill functionality to automatically populate login forms with the stored credentials when users visit websites. This can provide a seamless user experience and save time.

Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Add support for two-factor authentication, where users can enable an additional layer of security by verifying their identity using methods like SMS codes or authenticator apps.

Backup and Sync: Provide options for users to back up their password data and synchronize it across multiple devices. This ensures that their passwords are securely stored and accessible from different platforms.

Improve Security: Enhance the security of your password manager by implementing strong encryption algorithms, enforcing password requirements, and regularly updating the application to fix any security vulnerabilities.

Multi-platform Support: Extend your password manager to support multiple platforms such as desktop, web, and mobile devices, allowing users to access their passwords from anywhere.
